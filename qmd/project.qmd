# Projects

A **RStudio project** creates a **workspace** and **working directory** to help you organise and work with files that belong to a same project.

To create a new project, go to `File` > `New Project…` > `New Directory` (or `Existing Directory` if you want to create your project from an existing folder) > `New Project` and choose a `Directory name` for your project.

I recommend making a new RStudio project **everytime you start a new research project**. As a rule of thumb, whenever you have to work with at least two related files.

Because the working directory is relative to the project, it makes it very easy to navigate and access any files within a project.

E.g., to get the full path of a file, simply open quotes `""` and write the beginning of the file name or press `tab` to list all the files and folders in a project. Filter the list by typing part of the name and press `tab` to validate. The file is now ready to be read as demonstrated in the importing data section.
